# retro-watchfaces

This repo contains image files and information regarding the various watchfaces I've published on Facer.

You can view the faces [here](https://www.facer.io/user/74rwbwHC21)

Each one was hand-created in SVG, with VS Code as the IDE and the jock.svg extension for previewing. Some require additional fonts, so see the notes below:

## boy-and-watch

This is a Game Boy (DMG, Pocket, Light, Color and Advance) themed watch, available in square and round configurations and can be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=photography.davidgray.boyandwatch)

You'll need three four to recreate this:

* `Futura PT` for the "Dot Matrix", "Battery / Power", and "Boy And Watch" text
* `GAMECUBEN DualSet` for the "ADVANCE" text
* `Comic Sans MS` for the "COLOR" text
* `Arial` for the "SP" text

The boot and heart icons are hand-made using the [8-bit icon drawer](https://apollowayne.me/8bit-Icon-Drawer/index.html). The heart is my own creation, the boot is inspired by the pegasus shoes in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (because drawing 16x16 icons that look like things is tough!).

At the start of the SVG definition, there's two classes you can set, indicated by the IDs `colour-variation` and `case-variation`. Colour variation can be set to any one of these:

`grey`, `red`, `green`, `black`, `blue`, `white`, `gold`, `silver`, `silver-black`, `pink`, `berry`, `indigo`, `kiwi`, `yellow`, `teal`, `spice-orange`, `pokemon`, `ripcurl`, `famicom`, `famicom-gold`, `ozzie`, `transparent`, `transparent-yellow`, `always-on`

And case variation can be set to any one of these:

`gb`, `gbp`, `gbl`, `gbc`, `gba`, `gba-sp`, `gbm`

Note that some variants, like `ripcurl` and `pokemon` don't contain the decals due to copyright. Also, some combinations may not look as intended, and that's usually because the actual design it's modelled after doesn't exist for that combination (e.g. Ozzie! Ozzie! Ozzie! was for Game Boy Color only, and never existed on the DMG-01)

## watch-advance

This watchface has been superseded by the `boy-and-watch` face, but has a different layout so it's kept here.

A Game Boy Advance themed watch that can be found [here](https://www.facer.io/watchface/txlxlYrOWr)

You'll need three fonts to recreate this:

* `Futura PT` for the "WATCHBOY" text
* `GAMECUBEN DualSet` for the "ADVANCE" text
* `Atlantis International` for all the text in the watch face

## swatch

A Nintendo Switch themed watch. Requires no special fonts. This design uses a lot of variables to make things easy to change (e.g. the joycon width). NOTE: Be careful when uploading this to Facer, as you may run afoul of Nintendo

Pull requests welcomed, issues welcomed (but I only have a Pixel Watch to test on)
